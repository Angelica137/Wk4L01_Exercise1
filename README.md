## **Activity** *Pseudocode and algorithms analysis*

The aim of this activity is to practice the concepts learned in lesson 1. This activity contains 1 problem case.

After you have completed each exercise, add your answers, along with any code you write to your ePortfolio.

### Exercise one

There are two parts to this exercise:

1. Write an algorithm which takes an array of *n* integers as input and output the maximum element of the list.
2. Analyse its time complexity and express it using asymptotic notations.
